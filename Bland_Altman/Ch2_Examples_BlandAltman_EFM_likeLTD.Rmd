This document is derived from a .Rmd notebook created on 2020.02.20. That original notebook documented the code for performing a Bland-Altman analysis of two methods, and preparing graphs illustrating the results. It relies on the blandr and BlandAltmanLeh packages, as well as tidyverse and ggplot2.

#### Purpose:

The Bland--Altman Limits of Agreement (BA LoA), or simply Bland--Altman plots, are used widely in method comparison studies with quantitative outcomes. In such an analysis, a pair of observations is made from the same sample using two different methods. The means and differences of these pairs of values for each sample are plotted in a scatter plot. The plot shows a line for the estimated mean difference between the two methods, which is interpreted as a measure of the bias between the two methods. The limit of agreement lines are set such that approximately 95% of all population differences would lie. ***Tukey proposed something similar.*** Use of the BA LoA assumes that the differences are normally distributed, an assumption that can be checked.

BA LoA is a superior method for determining whether two methods achieve similar results when compared to simple scatter plots. It is used in this study as a primary means of comparing methods. Gerke (2020) [@gerke2020] set out a set of reporting standards when performing a BA analysis, suggesting 13 items be evaluated and reported when performing a BA analysis:

### Discussion

The very first Altman and Bland article [@altman1983] clearly outlines the issues associated with comparing two methods using the same samples. I could practically quote from much of it, and many of my thoughts were first articulated in this article (I'm proud to have thought of them independently).

I will start with this observation from the paper:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Asking the right question:*

*None of the previously discussed approaches tells us whether the methods can be considered equivalent. We think that this is because the authors have not thought about what question they are trying to answer. The questions to be asked in method comparison studies fall into two categories:*

*(a) Properties of each method:*

*How repeatable are the measurements?*

*(b) Comparison of methods:*

*Do the methods measure the same thing on average? That is, is there any relative bias?*

*What additional variability is there? This may include both errors due to repeatability and errors due to patient/method interactions. We summarize all this as "error".*

*Under properties of each method we could also include questions about variability between observers, between times, between places, between position of subject, etc. Most studies standardize these, but do not consider their effects, although when they are considered, confusion may result. Altman's (1979) criticism of the design of the study by Serfontein and Jaroszewicz (1978) provoked the response that: "For the actual study it was felt that the fact assessments were made by two different observers (one doing only the Robinson technique and the other only the Dubowitz method) would result in greater objectivity" (Serfontein and Jaroszewicz, 1979). The effects of method and observer are, of course, totally confounded.*

*We emphasize that this is a question of estimation, both of error and bias. What we need is a design and analysis which provide estimates of both error and bias. No single statistic can estimate both.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solution to a) repeatability of measurements is typically measured as the standard deviation, assuming the differences are normally distributed. Other more sophisticated requirements ensue if the repeatability is a function of the size of the measurement (as would be likely for untransformed LRs), or none may be suitable. If repeatability is independent of measurement size, then a one-way ANOVA is appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Comparison of methods*

*The main emphasis in method comparison studies clearly rests on a direct comparison of the results obtained by the alternative methods. The question to be answered is whether the methods are comparable to the extent that one might replace the other with sufficient accuracy for the intended purpose of measurement.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The solution to b) comparison of methods is the BA plot, I think. This does in fact visualize both error and bias.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The obvious first step, one which should be mandatory, is to plot the data. We first consider the unreplicated case, comparing methods A and B. Plots of this type are very common and often have a regression line drawn through the data. The appropriateness of regression will be considered in more detail later, but whatever the merits of this approach, the data will always cluster around a regression line by definition, whatever the agreement. For the purposes of comparing the methods the line of identity (A= B) is much more informative, and is essential to get a correct visual assessment of the relationship. An example of such a plot is given in Figure 1, where data comparing two methods of measuring systolic blood pressure are shown.*

![](images/image-1217418958.png)

*Although this type of plot is very familiar and in frequent use, it is not the best way of looking at this type of data, mainly because much of the plot will often be empty space. Also, the greater the range of measurements the better the agreement will appear to be.*

*It is preferable to plot the difference between the methods (A-B) against (A+B)/2, the average. Figure 2 shows the data from Figure 1 replotted in this way. From this type of plot it is much easier to assess the magnitude of disagreement (both error and bias), spot outliers, and see whether there is any trend, for example an increase in A-B for high values. This way of plotting the data is a very powerful way of displaying the results of a method comparison study.*

*As in the investigation of repeatability, we are looking here for the independence of the between-method differences and the size of the measurements. With independence the methods may be compared very simply by analysing the individual A-B differences. The mean of these differences will be the relative bias, and their standard deviation is the estimate of error. The hypothesis of zero bias can be formally examined by a [**paired t-test.**]{.underline}*

*Figure 3 shows these data (*from Carr et.al., referenced within the text of the article) *plotted in the suggested manner. Also shown is a histogram of the individual between-method differences, and superimposed on the data are lines showing the mean difference and a 95 per cent range calculated from the standard deviation. A composite plot like this is much more informative than the usual plot (such as Figure 1).*

![](images/image-513705151.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the technique became common within clinical medicine, the core requirements for displaying the results (average on the x-axis; 95% confidence intervals calculated from the standard deviation; mean of the difference shown (a measure of the bias between the two measurements); and the visualization of the differences between measurements to assess adherence to a normal distribution) were supplemented as indicated in the reporting Items from Gerke mentioned in the Introduction/Purpose.

In conclusion, I believe that the use of a BA plot to assess the differences between any two measurements each of which employs a different method is superior to either correlation calculations or scatterplots that include a line of identity (with or without a regression line included).
